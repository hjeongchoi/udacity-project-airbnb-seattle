# 1. Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# 2. Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using AirBnb Seattle data from 2016 to better understand:
1) What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike? 
2) Can you describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?
3) What are the main factors that the price of rooms? 

# 3. File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. It is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions above. You should unzip the data.zip file and these three files should be in the same folder with notebook file. 

# 4. Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
